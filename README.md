HamNets
-------

HamNets is a database and utility to facilitate hams (amature radio operators)
finding nets (on-air meetings).

My social/amature radio goal is to provide a convient and comprehensive
location for hams to find, or find out more about, nets that they can
participate in.

My technical goals towards acheiving that are to:

* keep the UI as light-weight and javascript-minimal as possible
* ensure that the front page especially contains time-dependent information 
* keep accessibility in mind
* build with an eye towards native use in multiple timezones and languages
